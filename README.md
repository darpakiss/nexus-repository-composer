# Nexus Repository Composer Format

This repository originated in a fork of the [Sonatype Nexus Repository Composer Format](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/nexus-repository-composer) plugin.
But due to lack of features and its experimental status, it has been rebooted using the nexus-repository-raw and composer tidbits from the original repository.

It is a work in progress, currently it supports:
- proxy repositories
- rest api to configure composer repositories
- support for upload package GUI
